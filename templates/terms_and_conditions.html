                By creating an Account, you agree to receive certain
                communications from Swirecare. For example, you will receive
                notifications, our newsletter and/or other promotional emails.
                You can opt-out of non-essential communications. Notices that we
                give you (other than notice of amendment of the Terms, which is
                discussed below) may be provided in any of the following ways.
                First, we may email you at the contact information you provide
                in your Registration Data. Second, we may post a notice to you
                in the User Account page of the Applications. Third, we may post
                the notice elsewhere on the Website or Applications. When we
                post notices on the Website or Applications, we post them in the
                area that is suitable to the notice. It is your responsibility
                to periodically review the Website or Applications for notices.

                The Service may provide communication channels such as forums,
                communities or chat areas (“Communication Channels”) designed to
                enable you to communicate with Clients. Swirecare is under no
                obligation to monitor these Communication Channels, but may do
                so and reserves the right to review materials posted to the
                Communication Channels and to remove any materials, at any time,
                with or without notice for any reason, at its sole discretion.
                Swirecare may also terminate or suspend your access to any
                Communication Channels at any time, without notice, for any
                reason. You acknowledge that chats, Postings, or materials
                posted by users of the Service on the Communication Channels are
                neither endorsed nor controlled by Swirecare, and these
                communications shall not be considered reviewed or approved by
                Swirecare. You will be solely responsible for your activities
                within the Communication Channels and under no circumstances
                will Swirecare be liable for any activity within the

                within the Communication Channels are public, and you have no

                choose to share on the Communication Channels, or for the

                may remain on the Service. The license you grant to us in

                validity and enforce-ability of any remaining provisions. Where
                a provision in the Terms is found to be unlawful, void or for
                any reason unenforceable, a lawful or enforceable term which
                best reflects the intention of the provision, as originally
                drafted, shall substitute. Our failure to enforce any right or
                provision of the Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right

                any such attempted assignment will be void and unenforceable.
                Violation of the Terms may cause us irreparable harm and,
                therefore, you agree that we will be entitled to seek
                extraordinary relief including, but not limited to, temporary
                restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent
                injunctions without the necessity of posting a bond or other
                security, in addition to and without prejudice to any other
                rights or remedies that we may have for a breach of the Terms.
